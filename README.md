todolistapp
===========

todolistapp using the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)

This app is a Simple To Do List app made while following this tutorial: 
http://thecodebarbarian.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/introduction-to-the-mean-stack-part-two-building-and-testing-a-to-do-list/

Current features only allow you to add a task to your list and check them off as completed. Everything is persistend and stored in a MongoDB database.
You need Node.js and MonboDB installed with the default settings for it to work.
